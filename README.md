bucket-list
===========

A list (in no particular order) of things I'd like to achieve or experience before I die. This list is by no means exhaustive, and will be revised and added to over time. Pull requests considered, thoroughly, then most likely rejected.

## The List

- [ ] See all of Asia
- [ ] Live without technology for a month while somewhere warm
- [ ] Have four year old son with long hair and converse sneakers
- [ ] Play rugby, get tackled violently
- [ ] Jump off of something high, parachute down
- [ ] Be in a band, perform at least five times, break up passionately
- [ ] Get married in secret
- [ ] Invent something people love
- [ ] Be in a crazy Savagesesque relationship for a Summer
- [ ] Live in Scandanavia for a little while
- [ ] Retire for at least a year before 2020
